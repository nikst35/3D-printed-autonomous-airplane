![RC Plane Image](https://github.com/nikst35/3D-printed-autonomous-airplane/blob/main/20231030_123549.jpg)

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a versatile RC plane platform that can serve as a foundation for autonomous flight and First Person View (FPV) recording. The design emphasizes lightweight, robust construction, and excellent aerodynamic stability.

## Key Features

- **Wingspan**: 2.05 meters
- **Fuselage Length**: 1.10 meters

- **Motor**: Turnigy D3530/12 motor with a 9-inch prop
- **Battery**: 4S Li-ion battery pack

### Fuselage Construction
The fuselage comprises five 3D-printed parts and a 1-meter-long carbon fiber tube with a V-shaped tail stabilizer.

### Motor Placement
The motor is positioned just behind and above the wing, set in a pusher orientation.

### Wing Construction
The wing features 3D-printed lightweight ribs connected with wooden trams and a carbon fiber square tube. It's covered with a thin sheet of balsa wood, further reinforced with heat-shrinkable film.

### Control System
The plane utilizes four servos for controlling ailerons and the V-tail.

### Wing Configuration
The wing is designed in a dihedral configuration and features custom 3D-printed winglets.

## Flight Control and Stability

For optimal flight performance and stability, it's advisable to use a flight controller with a gyro. This additional component enhances control and stability during flight. If you plan to implement autonomous GPS flights, a specialized ArduPilot controller is required. This controller facilitates autonomous navigation and waypoint-based flights, offering a wide range of features for advanced flight control and data collection.

## Battery
The plane is powered by a 4S Li-ion battery pack, providing the necessary energy for extended flights.

## Assembly Instructions

Provide detailed assembly instructions here, including any tips or considerations for assembling the plane.

## Usage

Include guidance on how to operate the RC plane effectively. This can cover takeoff, landing, recommended flying conditions, and any specific operational procedures.

## Media

Add images, videos, or links to recordings that showcase the plane in action. This helps users get a visual sense of the plane's capabilities.

## Contributing

If you're open to collaboration or contributions from the community, outline how others can get involved or provide feedback. Encourage users to share their experiences and improvements.
