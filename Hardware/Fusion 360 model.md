## 3D Models

- [Fusion 360 Project](https://a360.co/46NNRVe)

Explore the 3D models and designs used in this project on Fusion 360. You can view, modify, and 3D print the components for your own RC plane. 
Please note that during the creation of this project, I was relatively young and less experienced with Fusion 360. As a result, 
some of the geometry might not be 100% accurate, but they are functional and suitable for 3D printing.
